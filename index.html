	<h2>Test Results Group reflection</h2>
	<p>The tests conducted by the members of the group differed slightly however their strengths and weaknesses where always clearly identified.
		<br><br>
		
			<img src="images/group-test1.png" alt="" /></span><br>
		According to the various learning tests conducted by members of the group, 32% fell under the “visual learner” classification, while the remaining 68% where “tactile learners” (
		also known as "Kinesthetic").
		This proved to be highly beneficial to the group as large parts of the project required things to be tested and experimented with. 
		Additionally, most of the teamwork was conducted and coordinated through messaging and through Microsoft teams. </p>


		<p>The results of the Briggs Myers – 16 personalities tests where useful to the success of our team with no two members sharing the same exact personality type
			 and most where in different categories of personalities, allowing for a full range of input from across the spectrum to be considered. The majority of personalities
			  had an overall positive number of beneficial traits to the group ranging from leadership skills, entrepreneurial, creativity and mediation. 
			  This caused members to kind of ‘fall” into their own positions within the group, members were encouraged to work on tasks they
			  had knowledge about or that suited their strengths, allowing for members to work unsupervised and to their full potential.
			<br></p>
			<img src="images/meta-chart.png" alt="" /></span>
			<br><br>
			
			<p>Our weaknesses did not seem to have any immediate or noticeable effect upon the assignment as a whole. 
			Overall the project allowed us to see how valuable it is having different personalities working together in a team, 
			it showed us that having different personalities can positively impact performance and can create a balance that can assist in increasing the efficiency and quality 
			of work. </p>

								</blockquote>

						<p> After this the jobs tend to specialise. Most require programming skills, one predominantly requires
							  system testing abilities and the other centres around in-home customer support.<br>
								Education requirements: An undergraduate degree is a minimum for all positions. However
								one position requires a Masters Degree.<br>
								Career Paths: All team members wish to complete their undergraduate degree. After this all members plan
								different strategies. These range from no further studies to completing and Honours and Masters degrees.

										<h1> Blockchains and Cryptocurrencies</h1>
										<br>
										<h2>What are they, and what do they do?</h2>
										<br>

										<p>A blockchain is a digital record of transactions, where the name comes from individual records
											called blocks and they are linked together in a singular list called a chain.There are currently 861
											blockchains in the world and there are four different types of blockchains. The four types of
											blockchains are public, private, hybrid and federated. Cryptocurrency is a form of payment that
											can be exchanged between parties for good and services. As of January 2021 there are over 400
											cryptocurrencies in the world. Major cryptocurrencies are BitCoin, Ethereum, Cardano and XRP.
											BitCoin has a current market cap of 1.1 trillion dollars and Ethereum current market cap is 245
											billion dollars. To put Bitcoins market cap into perspective, Bitcoin has a bigger market cap than
											Facebook, Tesla, Samsung and Berkshire Hathaway.</p>
									<br>


		<button class="accordion" style = border:solid 1px;>More Information</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<br>
		<p>Bitcoins current market cap is the 8th
			biggest in the world right now with gold being in 1st position. Blockchains were first used by
			digital researchers in 1991, but it wasn’t really used until the Bitcoin owner in 2009 starting using
			blockchains. Blockchains store data in blocks which are then chained to another block. Once one
			block is filled with enough data another block is created and chained to the other block. For
			Bitcoin’s blockchain it is decentralised so no person or group of people have control instead
			everyone has control. A decentralised blockchain simply means that the data can’t be changed,
			so for example for Bitcoin every transaction that takes play is public for everyone viewing. As of
			currently for cryptocurrency and blockchains they are in its peak, since the launch of Bitcoin in
			2009 every year the cryptocurrency market has gained traction and is only becoming more
			adaptive and prevalent in the society that will live in. As the world and Australia tries to move into
			a cashless society the move for digital currency becomes increasingly more enticing for people.
			<br><br>
			All your cryptocurrencies can be held in the form of a digital wallet where they are all kept.
			Research show within the next few years cryptocurrencies will be a form of digital currency that
			will start to be accepted as a form of payment. Whether you are going to the shops with your
			credit card, a twenty dollar note or four hundred Dogecoin the choice could be yours with how
			you want to pay for your purchase. However the future of blockchains could drastically change
			how banks and payments work. Banks could save alot of money switching to blockchains.
			<br><br>
			 Another reason for a this move could be settlement of your money could change from a few days
			to only a few minutes. If society chooses to go into a blockchain path there will be the chance that
			people who work within the bank industry lose their jobs. The development of Bitcoin in 2009 by
			its owner Satoshi Nakamoto changed the view on blockchains and enhanced its perception to the
			public. The emergence of Bitcoin becoming such prevalent object within our global economy with
			ist enormous market cap and price, creating a movement towards a decentralised society. A real
			world example of a blockchain is Spotify, the music streaming service which in 2017 change to a
			decentralised data base to help with the artist licensing agreements of their music. Using a
			blockchain for Spotify was able to create a public record of the rights of who had ownership.</p>
			<br>

			<h2> What is the likely impact?</h2>
			<br>
			<p>The potential impact for cryptocurrencies and blockchains is they become a mainstream currency
				that we can use to purchase goods and services. Currently there is only a very small amount of
				business and companies that except some certain cryptocurrencies as payment but expect this
				number to drastically rise over the next few years. Positive impacts for cryptocurrency is that it is
				in the form of a digital wallet so its cashless and is a lot more safe. It has incredibly fast
				transaction times and very low fees swell which is great for investors. What’s likely to change
				about blockchains and cryptocurrency is how the world accepts these as a currency of the future.
				More and more cryptocurrencies and blockchains are going to be present as time goes on and
				how we choose to accept them will determine how the crypto coin or blockchain future will last.
				Cryptocurrencies will affect people who chose to invest in the currency at some point in time
				whether it’s made them profit or a loss. As the currency changes its value every second there is
				no set price over time, and so its a person or companies risk at which they choose to purchase
				the cryptocurrencies and blockchains price at. A company could ask for a certain amount of
				Bitcoin to purchase a product but overtime the price of bitcoin sky rockets so the company does
				really well off the trade or it could go the other way and it could plummet and the company makes
				a massive loss in the trade. Blockchains and cryptocurrency will continue to make jobs for the self
				employed who choose to day trade and will not make any jobs redundant in the short term future
				for anyone.</p>
				<br>
				<h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
				<br>
				<p>In our daily life, cryptocurrencies could be the future, investing and using the currencies for
					purchasing goods. As every day passes cryptocurrencies and blockchains are becoming more
					known and recognised. People are beginning to become more familiar with the coins intentions
					and what they are used for. This will affect people in everyday life as now companies are
					accepting various cryptocurrencies as payments to purchase goods that they sell. For example
					you can now buy a Tesla with Bitcoin rather then just sole $AUD. Using cryptocurrencies to pay
					for goods can have its benefits as you can buy the goods anonymously. However for the older
					generations that don’t quite understand what’s going on and what’s the point, they still use cash
					and may or may not use tap and go. Cryptocurrency will be used in the future starting with the
					younger generations. Unlike stocks, when purchasing cryptocurrencies you don’t have to
					purchase a whole entire crypto coin. Currently Bitcoin in Australia is $82k which for most is too
					expensive to buy a full Bitcoin, so any amount that you chose to buy of the Bitcoin will be
					converted from AUD to Bitcoin which is appealing as you can own 1/8 of a Bitcoin if you like.
					Family will have to learn about cryptocurrencies form the younger generations as this is the

		<h1> Cyber security</h1>
		<br>
		<h2>What does is it, what does it do?</h2>
		<br>

		<p> Cyber security is the method or practice of defending: networks, computers, servers, mobile devices, 
			other forms of technology and data from malicious attackers. Cyber security is often referred to as “Information Security” 
			or “Information technology security” however they do slightly differ from one another. 
			Generally speaking, cyber security encompasses multiple different terminologies, technologies and defensive countermeasures that 
			together form the umbrella term of “cyber security.” Some of these technologies and methods are outlined below:
		</p>

			<button class="accordion" style = border:solid 1px;>More Information</button>
			<div class="panel">
			<p>
			<ul> 
			<li>
				Network security: Network security encompasses the methods and technologies (such as Network intrusion prevention and detection systems, 
				firewalls and network authenticity methods) to secure networks from unwanted or unpermitted parties from accessing the network.
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
				Application Security: Application security is the process and ability of ensuring applications and software remain safe for users
				and remain threat free. Application security should be considered during the design of the application in question, issues, potential
				vulnerabilities and threats should be identified and addressed accordingly, application security also ensures the integrity of data and 
				  user / private information handled and stored by the application.
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
				Information security: Information Security is a broader category of security than cyber; however, they are closely related.  
				Information security relates to the protection of information in physical and digital form, the two relate in the digital realm where information
				may be passed through networking, applications, or other online services. (for example your credit card information when purchasing something  online).
			</li>
			<br>
			</ul>					
			<p>Cyber security is an ever-evolving group of technologies, with the origins of the field being sceptical and debatable 
				however cyber security did start to become an emerging technology in the late 70’s and early 80’s with the first viruses (worms) 
				being created and released around this time. <br>
				The field came into prominence during the late 80’s and early 90’s as an early and relatively undefended Internet started to become more popular
				as the number of people connecting increased, malicious actors who would become to be known as “cyber criminals” realised that they could earn money by stealing data,
				and other forms of personal data often extorting the victim in-exchange for the release of their information. 
				During this period there was an explosion of companies offering security services to customers,
				<a href="https://www.eset.com/au/">Nod32</a>, <a href="https://au.norton.com">Norton</a>, and  <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/index.html">Mcafee</a> 
				where among the first and most popular.<br>
				 Over time billions of dollars and countless hours of research, 
				development and collaboration where spent to advance technologies, construct counter measures and enforce unity amongst Internet protocols
				to ensure that the end user and the various forms of data utilised today are kept safe.<br><br>
				The development of Quantum and super computers poses several challenges to cyber security in particular to cryptology,
				 advanced computers are capable of breaking the most secure of cryptographic algorithms. This would render the current cryptographic standards obsolete 
				 and would grant malicious actors the ability to gain access to any information encrypted anywhere in the world within seconds, p
				 rovided they knew what they where looking for. As a result of this threat NIST ( the National Institute of Standards and Technology)
				  from the USA is currently working on a “post -quantum cryptographic solution” their goal is to create standards of encryption to replace the current standards 
				  that will be eventually rendered obsolete they hope to have a draft submitted with the first algorithm/s some time between 2022-2024. 
				  While this is good progress in attempting to prevent obsolescence and the inevitable catastrophe that would occur should significant advances in
				   Quantum or supercomputing within a few years, Implementing the necessary changes required to safeguard users,
				    and data In various forms could take up to 25 years <a href="https://edps.europa.eu/sites/default/files/publication/07-08-2020_techdispatch_quantum_computing_en_0.pdf">(source)</a>
					 to be fully implemented.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h2>What is likely the impact?</h2><br>
			<p> The global Impact of cybercrime is massive, in the united states there is an attempted attack roughly every 40 seconds, 
				or over 2200 a day with the average cost of a data breach totalling around 3.9Million USD. To put this into perspective, 
				a famous attack on Equifax (a multinational credit bureau) in 2017 has costed the company $4 Billion USD, 
				the company is still paying off the loans it had to get to pay for damages. <br><br>
				Cyber crime is undoubtedly a serious problem within today’s society,
				 with the cost of cyber crime increasing year after year and the types of attack becoming increasingly sophisticated cyber security experts and professionals
				 are becoming a hot commodity for corporations and governments alike in a desperate attempt to thwart the onslaught of attacks. 
				 Despite governments and corporations spending Billions of dollars every year trying to stop cybercrime, 
				the number of attacks every year and may increase for decades to come, 
				only 53% of the worlds population have access to the internet leaving another roughly 3.2Billion people disconnected, most living in very poor countries.
				 As the worlds poorest citizens start to gain the ability to connect to the internet some will seize the opportunity and overlook the 
				repercussions to commit crimes online from the relative safety of their homes for what is often perceived as easy money. <br><br>
				The problem of cybercrime is multifaceted and there is no single solution to prevent an attack,
				 a disgruntled employee may leak Intellectual property, user data or integral company Information out of spite, 
				 a frustrated customer may seek vengeance after they feel that they have been unjustly treated or a government employee may leak sensitive documents for moral reasons.
				  Whatever the reason for the attack the number of attacks and the frequency that they occur is likely to continue to increase for some time.
			</p>
			<h2>How will this affect you?</h2><br>
			<p>Cyber security and the threat of cybercrime is becoming a part of everyday life, its significance and importance of comprehension have been realised. 
				It is likely that a higher understanding of cyber crime and how to avoid becoming a victim will be emphasised and taught to a higher degree in the generations to come, 
				educating the next generations of how to avoid becoming a victim of cybercrime will still be as relevant as it is today as the sophistication and complexity of attacks
				 increases. There is no “one size fits all” solution to any security problem, cyber security is no different and constant and continuous education to end users and 
				 developments to security protocols and technologies will continue and will likely increase in intensity.<br>
				 It is important in this day and age to be at least somewhat aware of what cyberattacks are occurring and when they are occurring often compromised
				  personal information is sold however the effects can be mitigated by staying aware and changing passwords and information if you or a corporation
				   that holds your data has been compromised. It is also becoming more important to understand how certain criminals can circumvent security safeguards 
				   and protocols in order to gain your information or trust this tactic is known as “social engineering” and is the root cause of a large percentage of 
				   attacks and data breaches. Overall cyber security is becoming more of an issue for ordinary people the need to educate the next generations and poorer 
				   nations with a minority of citizens connected to the internet will be challenge over the coming decades.

										<h1> Autonomous Vehicles</h1>
										<br>
										<h2>What does is it, what does it do?</h2>
										<br>
										<p> Autonomous vehicles that can sense its surrounding environment and operate without any human
											interaction, therefor the is no need for human control and the vehicle does all the work and takes
											you to your destination. There are five levels of vehicle automation: No automation, driver
											assistance, partial automation, conditional automation, high automation and full automation.
											There are currently no full automation cars available to purchase at the moment but testing is
											currently undergoing. Research and investment into the future of autonomous vehicles occur
											every day even though we are still a few years away companies continue to pour money into
											prototypes and research as they believe this will be the hit. Companies such as Uber are heavily
											relying on autonomous vehicles to come and be prevalent as they want to cut cost with needing
											no driver and there for a car can just come to your house and pick you up and take you to your
											destination.</p>
								
										
									<button class="accordion" style = border:solid 1px;>More Information</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<br>
		<p>Therefore a car can just come to your house and pick you up and take you to your
			destination. Currently plenty of companies are doing the research necessary to be able to
			construct autonomous vehicles, companies such as Waymo, GM Cruise, Argo and Tesla are all
			leading the way in this field. Currently we are in Level 3 and 4 for autonomous vehicles which
			means for Level 3 that the human driver must respond to requests from the automated driving
			system. Level 4 is the same as level three but there is less need for human control or intervention
			when the operating system is in automated mode. Predictions says Level 5 vehicles will be
			released late 2021 and 2022, and this is when the automated system is in control at all times and
			in all types of road environments. Although this will not be vastly available this type of car will
			become available to a select range of people who can afford to spend the money to purchase the
			car. Within the next three years autonomous vehicles are set to hit the roads in selected parts of
			the world. The vehicles will most likely be able to be fully autonomous on highway rather than in
			densely populated areas. Companies such as Ford, GM, Honda, Toyota and Tesla, have all plans
			by the end of 2021 to be fully autonomous on highways. Within the next three years autonomous
			driving in suburban areas does not look like a thing that will exist just yet. It appears to be still a
			few years away looks are later in the 2020s. <br><br>
			According to studies fully autonomous vehicles that
			are expected to drive everywhere are expected between 2025-2030. There are plenty of technical
			advances that make autonomous vehicles possible such as artificial intelligence, sensor systems,
			security and network infrastructure. The emergence of AI over the past few years has helped the
			autonomous car industry to boom. Within your autonomous vehicles is responds to deep learning
			which reads to neurone activity of the car which then responds to voice, speech, image and
			motion detection. Within an autonomous car and also on the outside it is packed with cameras
			and sensors which helped the cars to be safe on our roads. A major problem that could be faced
			with autonomous vehicles is hacking and hijacking of the car, as it's all technology, hackers are
			able to get into the system. Tesla held an event with they asked two people to try to hack into
			their Tesla Model 3, within minutes the men were able to get within the system and take over.
			Tesla then resolved the issue and patched it up, but all thanks to the learning curve the men gave
			by getting into their system.</p>
			<br><br>
			<h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
			<br>
			<p>The potential impact for autonomous vehicles is huge for the world and how we travel. An
				immediate impact is that fully autonomous cars are safer on our roads as they take away human
				error which equates to roughly 94% of crashes on our roads. This will make our roads and
				travelling alot more safer. Deaths on our roads will be lowered but as more people will go to fully
				autonomous vehicles as they become more available. Fully autonomous cars require zero human
				control when the car drives you to your destination. 
				<br>
				Major impact for car dealers and brands that
				don’t supply or offer this product will how to adjust and look to offer as this is the way off the
				future as all signs point to autonomous cars and electric cars such as Tesla look to take over.
				Some facts about what fully autonomous vehicles will do in Australia are, they will improve
				transport interconnectivity, reduce transport energy consumption by up to 90%, greater mobility
				for the elderly and disabled. This will hugely affect the elderly and the disabled as now they are
				able to get transport by themselves. Allowing them to hop into the car and arrive at their
				destination without a career being their to help the disabled or for the elderly who may have
				impaired vision. this will continue for them to do every day routines without the inconvenience of
				not having a vehicle for themselves to transport on their own. Each and every person will be
				affected by autonomous vehicles but not in the same way, companies like Uber are banking on
				autonomous vehicles and as a result Uber drivers and other ride share drivers will become
				redundant as they won’t be needed to drive the car.</p>
				<br>
			<h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
			<br>
			<p>In our daily life, autonomous vehicles can change the way we get to and from work or other
				various locations we desire to go. Autonomous vehicles are still around 5 - 10 years away from
				being properly regulated onto our roads. In the short term there will be no change to our lives
				except for the growing anticipation of what’s to come for the car industry. Tesla are around 1 year
				away from introducing the level 5 version of full automation. This extra can be purchased for your
				Tesla at the cost of $10,000 USD. As there are not many companies that are currently producing
				fully autonomous cars the price for these cars are expensive. Due to the high price majority of
				people will not be able to afford having such a car. <br><br>
				Our lives won’t drastically change for around
				another 5-10 years where the impact of fully autonomous vehicles we have a much heavier
				presence on our roads. This will allow us to feel much safer while driving and the stress and
				anxiety of driving a car for some people will be lowered. As the cars are not around yet they
				haven’t made any changes to road rules, for instance the car driver can’t use their phone when
				they are driving the car, so will the rule still be the same when the car drives itself and you the so
				called driver sits there and waits for the arrival at your destination. If this rule is allowed it will
				change the way we transport, We will be able to eat breakfast in the car, or reply to work emails,
				and all of this can be done outside of the car but doing this while your car drives you to work
				saves time. Everyone will be effected by autonomous vehicles including family and friends, from
				personal experience parents stress about when their new daughter or son get their license and go
				and drive a car. They might have an accident or be stupid and try things they shouldn’t on the
				road. The autonomous vehicles will take the stress away as the car drives itself and leaving the
				parents less stressed.</p>

		<h1>Machine learning</h1>
		<p>Machine learning is a form of Artificial Intelligence that can learn to make accurate predictions and improve its accuracy in an autonomous fashion, by being analyzing data and in some cases through real-world interactions.
			At its core machine learning is about analyzing data and making predictions based off the information fed to the underlying algorithm this data is parsed and an outcome is produced.
			There are a number of different algorithms a machine learning application can utilize. The algorithm is generally selected depending on the purpose or desired function of the application.  Some of them are outlined below:
			</p>
		<button class="accordion" style = border:solid 1px;>More Information</button>
					<div class="panel">
					<p>
						<ul><li> <b>Supervised:</b> Supervised learning is the name given to the algorithm utilized when the application or machine learning itself is undertaken in a controlled and supervised environment, 
							the operator or user provides the machine with a dataset, inputs or outputs and is aware of what the result should be. 
							The machine analyzes the data and inputs and attempts to identify patterns to learn and observes, after this the machine makes a prediction or a determination, 
							this is then corrected by the user or operator until the machine achieves a higher level of performance.</li>
							<br><br>
							<li>
								<b>Semi- supervised:</b> Semi supervised learning is similar to Supervised learning however the machine is fed both labelled and unlabeled data,
								 basically labeled data is data that already has a pre-determined meaning or function and unlabeled data does not, by analyzing the data the machine learns to label unlabeled data.
								  This type of machine learning is very common and is commonly used on websites that require a the user to “Enter a captcha” or to click on the pictures matching a word.
							</li>
							<br><br>
							<li>
								<b>Unsupervised:</b> Unsupervised learning is when there is no operator or user to provide instruction or correction, 
								the machine analyzes data to identify patterns, the machine learns to determine the correlations and relationships. 
								This is commonly used for a machine to analyze or interpret large datasets and to sort, label or address that data in accordance with its function, 
								the results can vary the machine may group the data, or it may simply re-arrange the data.
							</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					As previously stated, there are many different approaches that can be taken in order to get machines to learn, from basic decision trees to layering artificial neural networks, 
					the way in which the machine is taught is heavily dependent upon what exactly the desired end result is, from advanced medical devices,
					 to autonomous vehicles Machine learning has started to become more mainstream with many companies starting to implement or research their own variant to
					  increase performance and gain a competitive edge. <br>
					  <br>
					  A common misconception shared by many about machine learning is that machine learning is all about automation and making everything autonomous. 
					  While automation is becoming increasingly more popular machine learning is also often utilized to simply identify patterns, 
					  especially when there is an incredibly large amount of data to be analyzed and the best way to analyze the data is unknown, 
					  a machine learning application can analyze this data in a fraction of the time a human can and can produce some tangible result.<br>
					  <br>
					  While for many people the future seems to hold a world of total automation, there are still many complex problems that need to be solved,
					   for instance it is not uncommon for the machine to learn seemingly random things when analyzing new data. 
					   Another problem is that when a learning algorithm is not working or functioning properly the easiest solution seems to be to feed the machine more data, 
					   however time and available data can quickly become a serious problem.
				</p>


					<h2>What is likely the impact?</h2>
					<br>
					<p>The likely impact of machine learning seems hard to gauge, it is not uncommon to hear about a company developing some new revolutionary robot, or a self-driving car, 
						that will hit the markets within the next few years or so. However, as the years go by these stories appear to fade and on the surface, 
						it seems as if it was all a fantasy and have been long forgotten about.
						However, the issue of projects failing and falling out of the public view is multifaceted and does not necessarily mean that the underlying machine learning aspect of the idea was the reason for the failure. 
						Machine learning is becoming more mainstream there are many corporations that are attempting to implement some variant for numerous reasons, 
						it is so far fetched to imagine that not so far in the future Machine learning will have a more central role within society.
						The presence of machine learning is likely to increase in both visibility and behind the scenes, 
						the development of more advanced and super computers will only exacerbate the rate of which machine learning becomes more feasible and the speed of which learning can be achieved.</p>

					<br><br>
					<h2> What does this mean for you?</h2>
					<p>As technologies advance, they inevitable make their way into and solidify themselves within the lives of ordinary people. 
						Machine learning has the capacity to assist in the advancement of other technologies such as autonomous vehicles,
						 security and healthcare which can lead to a higher standard of living for the average person. 
						 Machine learnings unique ability to learn makes it both a powerful tool to refine existing systems and technologies and to assist in the creation of new ones, overall, 
						 the impact that machine learning will have is likely to be highly positive machine learning can also be used to make certain dangerous jobs safer or automated, 
						 such as bomb disposal, deep sea diving and traffic controlling. 
						 The impacts of which machine learning will have upon the job market is uncertain and is heavily debated however if machine learning can assist in providing in a higher standard 
						 of living for all a blow to the job market may be a fair trade off.
						  This is likely to not be realized for at least a number of decades and is heavily dependent upon a number of other factors.</p>

									<u>	<h1> Interview with an IT Professional </h1> </u>
	
									<p>Our report is based on an interview with Guy Gershoni (Manager - MYOB Australia)
										conducted on Wednesday 7th April 2021. </p>
	
									<p>We would like to express our deepest appreciation to Guy for his kind assistance in making
										 this report possible.</p>
	
									<p>	Note:  <br>
										  Before the meeting, Guy gave us permission to record visually, orally and as a transcript.
											He also gave us permission to be quoted by name.
											We have provided him with a copy of the report before submission.<br>
											A transcript of the interview can be found [here]:
	
	
	
	
									<h2>Reflection</h2>
									<p> The interview went well in general. Guys's stories were enlightening not only were they full of
										  information, but were also easy to understand. We enjoyed the interview, because we got to know a
											sliver of Guy’s experience and observed his passion for IT. On reflection, what we learned from
											the interview, it is clear that the IT industry presents many interesting opportunities but also has its unique
											challenges. The main thing that we learned from Guy is "whether you're working in different areas,
											or in different fields, there's still core ideas and core principles that you bring to each job
											which evolve over the years". The other fascinating ascpect that Guy told us is "it never stays stagnant, there's always new things on
											the block". We have a much greater appreciation that the IT industry is ever-changing meaning that we always have to learn something new to keep up with the industry, 
											even though they are based on solid principles that change less over the years. The good thing about this situation is that as long as we continue to learn, the job over our lifetimes will be many and varied.</p>
	
									<h3 style="color:#a62526;">What kind of work is done by I.T. Professional</h3>
									<p> Guy is an Engineering Manager, and he is responsible for managing a team that is improving and supporting some infrastructure aspects of MYOB’s technology. 
										He runs a team of approximately 15 people and they are regularly improving hand-written Kubernetes elements that were written a few years ago and now are being superseded by 
										Amazon Web Services (AWS) components.  He is focused on having the team modernize and simplify the technology stack. 
										A lot of his work is spent coordinating his team, understanding what is happening, and mediating between different parties to ensure a good result is delivered. 
										He ensures that he hires smart and capable people, and enables them to be independent by providing context and guiding them in the right direction. 
										He believes that the team of specialists should be autonomous rather than micro-managed, ensuring a good reliability and performance of the systems they deliver.</p>
	
								 <h3 style="color:#a62526;">Who do I.T. professional interact with?</h3>
									<p>Guy’s interactions are limited to MYOB’s internal teams, and he does not have opportunity to interact with different companies, clients, or accountants.
										Guy’s team is an internal service provider for other teams in MYOB.  This is because the technology he delivers is the framework of systems and 
										infrastructure that enable the other MYOB technology teams to operate. 
										In this way, the other MYOB teams are internal clients who have high expectations of him. 
										
										As an internal service provider, 
										he receives specifications from different teams and
										must negotiate, discuss, and deliver products that the teams require.
										
										As a manager, he interacts with his own team members to deliver on the specifications required, 
										involving supporting and directing the team, and mediating issues both within the team and with internal customers’ requirements.</p>
	
								 <h3 style="color:#a62526;">Where do I.T. professional spend most of the time?</h3>
								 <p> Guy spends most of his time doing managerial tasks that are focused on ensuring that his teams are working effectively. 
									 He is responsible for three different teams covering:
										1.On premise support – as there are legacy platforms that are yet to be moved to the cloud, this team must continue to ensure the system is reliable and maintained.
										2.Kubernetes cluster – this compute cluster supports more than 200 million requests a month, but only has four team members.
										3.Design Systems – this team maintains a Javascript library that is used by the rest of the company to give a consistent look and feel and avoid different solutions to the same problem. 

									As a manager, Guy must coordinate his team but also deal with complex issues that may have multiple solutions and opinions that have to be mediated.  
									We could hear from talking with Guy that dealing with three very different teams and internal stakeholders was a lot of work.</p>
	
								<h3 style="color:#a62526;">What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h3>
								<p> Guy divided his challenges into two elements - technical and managerial.<br>
									  <u>	Technical: </u>The technical challenge is to understand complex problems and then determine the best way to provide a solution, within the environment which they work. 
										Often there is a trade-off between the short-term resolution and redesigning the whole system which is a far larger task. 
										As an example, many of the hand-written Kubernetes items can now be easily delivered by standard AWS components, but there is work to be done to make this transition. <br>
									  <u>	Managerial:</u> The managerial challenge is to have enough technical skill to understand problems in less than 20 minutes, 
										and guide teams to come up with a solution and sometimes arbitrate different solutions between team members. 
										Guy found that some of the technical team members had regular disagreements over code, and he had to help resolve the differences between the people. 
										He finds that he has to plan how he can keep the team “humming well” so that they continue to provide value to the business.
										Guy mentioned a book: “Turn The Ship Around!”[1] written by a Captain of a nuclear
										submarine in the US Navy. The captain created autonomy in the boat’s teams, thereby turning his
										boat from one of the worst performing to one of the best.  Guy added that he is trying to apply
										this managerial style to his teams vis-a-vis the command-and-control model. As Guy stated: <br>
									“If I’m doing my job well, it means the teams look after themselves and can deal with the clients
									  themselves and I can watch cat videos” </p>
	
								<h3 style="color:#a62526;">How do they keep their technology skills current?</h3>
								<p>	Guy listed a number of places / strategies that he uses for keeping up to date.<br>
								 </ul>
								 
									  <li><a href ="https://slashdot.org"> "Slashdot.org</a> a “News for Nerds” site which he reads every day, to learn the latest trends.</li>
									  <li>Attend conferences like YAO  (Young Atom Optician). A platform to learn from and extend
											his network with peers.</li>
									  <li>Guy also does side projects with friends. He usually have one or two projects going at any one time.
											Whilst these projects haven't yet resulted in a “billion-dollar startup” he’s learned many
											skills that helped get him the next job.</li>
								</ul></p>
	
								<h3 style="color:#a62526;">Can they share an example that best captures the essence of the IT industry?</h3>
								<p>Guy recalled a project going back 10 years. <br>
									 The on-line platform they created was for Associated Retailers Limited to allow their franchisees
									 (Toy World, Men’s Land, Sports Power etc) to order stock. Prior to this, franchisees had to order
									 stock manually over the phone or by posting spreadsheets.<br>
									 The platform developed was a B-to-B e-commerce site. Guy added that one of the most interesting
									 aspects of the platform was designing the respective interfaces (layouts, fonts, colours etc),
									 which had to cater for variances between franchisees that expected it to be adaptable to all their
									 individual needs.<br>
									 The platform was then integrated into the stores Point of Sale (POS) systems so that ordering
									 became almost automatic. <br>
									 Guy added that one of the spin offs from the system was the amount of information now available online.
									 Then it was called “Business Intelligence”, now it’s called “Data Analytics”.
									 Businesses can now see patterns and trends and react accordingly.</p>

						<p>We would like to express our deepest appreciation to Guy Gershoni for his contribution to this article.<br>

						<h3><p><b>Question: What aspect of their job they find the most challenging? </b></h3>

						<p><b><u>Answer:</b></u> Guy divided it into two elements, which is the technical and managerial part as an
						Engineer Manager.The challenging part of the technical aspect is he is still involved in people management,
						planning and strategic work. It’s what they call “Level 3” work. Understanding and providing solutions or
						insights to overcome a problem. Guy said what he finds really challenging as an Engineering Manager is being
						able to communicate effectively with the business and understand what they business is trying to do.
						Understand the capabilities and opportunities in the teams and then working out how to build a plan
						where he can provide value to the business and keep the team sort of “humming well”. </p>
	
						<h3><p><b>Question: Please tell us about your IT work </b></h3>

						<p><b><u>Answer:</b></u> I work at MYOB at the moment, so we basically run a couple of million customers now
						and we look after Australia and New Zealand financial services for companies a lot more than just small
						businesses. We do run enterprise businesses, financial services. We do a lot of work with accountants and
						practitioners so. The company is not small. I think we have got about 1000 IT developers and people who work
						in IT and then probably another thousand who do customer support sales and marketing, legal and others. So,
						it’s a big small company. </p>
	
						<h3><p><b>Question:	Where do you spend most of you time? </b></h3>

						<p><b><u>Answer:</b></u> here I work, I look after a couple of teams that basically look after the
						infrastructure for the team. So, we provide the platforms and the services that other teams use for delivering
						the products to the end customers. So, I got one team that looks after some of we still have on Prem in
						2021 that we are aggressively moving that into the cloud. We’ve got another team that has a what they call
						a Kubernetes cluster so it’s sort of ephemeral compute sort of cluster that we run. It’s one of the largest
						in Australia, does about 200,000,000 requests a month, and that’s a team of only four people at the moment
						trying to grow that out. And I also look after another team called the “Design Systems Team” and what they
						do is build a library, like JavaScript library that is used by the rest of the company to build various
						applications/ online applications and it gives everyone a consistent look and feel. Previous to this group,
						MYOB has quite a number of products that they’ve acquired and built over the years. There was something
						like 17 different date pickers or something, so they wanted to create a consistent experience as a customer
						moves from one experience to another. So, one product to another. So, the transition isn’t jarring because
						the look and feel is still consistent, so those are the teams that I look after. </p>
	
	
						<h3><p><b>Question:	What’s your interaction like with clients? Who are the different people you work with and
							can you please tell us about them? </b></h3>

						<p><b><u>Answer:</b></u> I’m away at this stage of my career, so when you say clients, I don’t work with the
						accountants and small businesses owners, but our clients are the people who are using our platforms and I work
						a lot with them, so I’ll work a lot with sort of the various other teams and understand what’s going on and
						mediate between. I have to balance the work that the teams need to get done to maintain the current level of,
						reliability and performance in the systems with the feature requests and bug fixes that need to be done for
						another requested by the client. So even though I don’t work with the end customer per say, our team still
						have a lot of clients that we deal with. There’s a very good book called “Turn the ship around” which is about
						a captain of a nuclear submarine in the American Navy, and he sort of talks about essentially creating
						autonomy in teams. So, if I’m doing my job well, it means the teams look after themselves and can deal with
						the clients themselves and I can watch cat videos, I think that’s a big shift in IT management over the last
						sort of 10-15 years. Has been from a command-and-control kind of mechanism. You know I am the boss and I know
						everything that’s going on. I remember in Telstra getting in trouble because I hired a guy with a double
						degree ANU in computer vision and mathematics and for some reason I didn’t know everything he did everyday
						and my boss was upset. You know it’s a command-in-control and now my job is to hire people smarter more
						capable than myself. Which is getting easier and easier over the years. Essentially giving those teams the
						autonomy, so I don’t tell people what to do. I provide them with enough context for them to try and work out
						what the right decisions are. </p>
	

						<h3><p><b>Question:	What is your position? </b></h3>

						<p><b><u>Answer:</b></u> I’m at an engineering manager level. I look after three teams, about 15 people.
						With IT you can do a lot with small team. And you can get very little done in a very big team </p>
	

						<h3><p><b>Question:	How did you begin your career/ How did you become interested in this field?</b></h3>

						<p><b><u>Answer:</b></u> I was interested in computer back in the 80’s, mainly because you know I have mild
						dyslexia. SO, I really love the spell checker. That’s sort of how I fell in love with computers and I did a
						bit of programming and was bit of a nerd. Then eventually I actually was more interested in doing Social
						Sciences Anthropology and I took a year off university and then I suddenly realized that having money is a
						good idea, and I eventually transferred into business computing, lots of programming and algorithms but not
						as computer science. And that was great, and I graduated in 1998-1999 just when the bubble was going, I had
						a lot of fun back when everything was kind of mad and then experience the bubble bust and it’s been one of
						those careers that I just have had short periods where sort of come out of it for a few years but then always
						seem to find my way back because the job keeps evolving. It’s a very interesting career, it never stays
						stagnant, there’s always new things on the block. Which have a lot of relevance to what you have been doing,
						so having 20 years of experience gives you a lot of very useful context, and it’s a very international trade.
						I’ve worked in Israel and companies in America and Europe as well, it’s been an interesting career. </p>
	
						<h3><p><b>Question:	How do you keep your technology skills current? </b></h3>

						<p><b><u>Answer:</b></u> Not as well as I should have, you have to. I have certain resources “Slashdot.org”,
						it’s been around since mid-90’s, and that’s where I got to each day. I sort of checkup and read what’s going
						on from a trend perspective and I also make it a point to work with companies that supports us with training
						budget and I’ll try and attend general conferences like YAO where people talk about various aspects of what’s
						going on in the industry. I also do side hustles, I have my day job and usually have one or two things that
						I poke around with friends, to experiment, the side hustles usually end up, if they don’t become the next
						“Unicorn” or like a billion-dollar startup, I learned some interesting skills that helped me get the next
						job. </p>
	
						<h3><p><b>Question:	What kind of technologies, software’s or online resources that you use the most to help
							you do your job? </b></h3>

						<p><b><u>Answer:</b></u> In my day job, I have been writing job ads, and we have specific tool called “Textio”,
						that helps us understand how we use our language and what that might affect as far as would it attract people
						of certain age ranges or detract people of certain ranges and genders and etc. We use a tool called “Jira” for
						managing projects and workflows. There’s a couple of custom tools for me to manage like people and HR related
						issues. We use “Slack” a lot for conversation, calling people, meetings, and emails. </p>
	

						<h3><p><b>Question:	Which aspect of work do you find most challenging? </b></h3>
						<p><b><u>Answer:</b></u> There’s always a technical aspect and even as an engineering manager, most of my day
						is around people management, planning and strategic work. It’s what they call “Level 3” work. I still need
						to be technical enough that the teams can explain to me a problem and I can understand it enough within 10-20
						minutes that I can help them come to a solution or sometimes arbitrate. A team last quarter, they were two guys
						I was looking after and they bicker a lot over code. They have this thing called “pull request” which one will
						write code and then they’ll say I want to merge this into the production code. And the other person reviews
						that code using something like GitHub. They’ll review that code and then they’ll decide whether its good or
						not or what should be changed. And usually this is a great process where developers feel confident because
						there’s other developer’s looking at their code. Some of the really critical systems like “Kubernetes Cluster”
						we actually have on the repository’s that manage that, we actually need two people to approve a pull request,
						not one. We need two sets of eyes, other than the developer to review that code before it goes into production
						anyway, they were arguing so I had to understand enough about what they were trying to do and how they are
						coding to help them come to a compromise in a resolution. So, there’s that engineering part. But I think what
						I find really challenging now is being able to communicate effectively with the business. So, my job right
						now is not as much in the technical realm, its more around trying to understand what the business is trying
						to do. Understand what are the capabilities and opportunity in the teams and then working out how to then
						build some kind of road map or a plan where we sort of can provide value to the business and keep the team
						sort of humming well. </p>
	

						<h3><p><b>Question:	What are you working on at the moment? </b></h3>

						<p><b><u>Answer:</b></u> One of the interesting projects about IT is in the old days, they used to think was 
						IT was like an infrastructure hardware. Like CapEx [Capital Expenditure] vs OpEx [Operational Expenditure]
						conversation. So, we have the plan, the project and then you build it and then it would go and that’s your 
						CapEx spend and then that’s your OpEx and it would be like business-as-usual mode. And that’s not just the way
						that software works. Unfortunately, you are constantly evolving software, and one of the teams, the Kubernetes
						Team, they rolled out this platform about three years ago and back then there weren’t a lot of tools available.
						They had to do a lot of implementation themselves. They rolled out a lot of the infrastructure themselves.
						What’s happened over the last three years is that Kubernetes is very popular now and we use Amazon Web
						ervices a lot. They have now a lot of services that do what we handcrafted three years ago, and some of the
						work at the moment we’re doing has a lot of planning, investigation and testing before it actually start
						moving things across but were slowly trying to move the world from being stuff that we need to worry about to
						stuff that Amazon Web Services does for us, so that the team can then refocus on building out features and
						fixing problems that the business actually cares about, that is unique to MYOB, not solving a general problem  </p>
	
						<h3><p><b>Question:	Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of
							the IT industry? </b></h3>

						<p><b><u>Answer:</b></u> I think one of the most successful projects I was involved in and this is going back
						10 years ago. This was for a group called Associated Retailers Limited, they are the back end of Toy World,
						Men’s Land, Sports Power and etc. They are actually the franchisee owners where they run their own “Meredith”,
						where they run their own brands. And our job was to come in and initially was to develop a B-to-B e-commerce
						site. This is back in mid to late 2000’s. It was revolutionary because at that stage prior to that, for
						franchisee owners to order stock was a really painful manual process, where they have to sit there and discuss
						things over the phone or send spreadsheets if they were capable enough and similar other issues involved.
						So, we sort of set up a B-to-B ecommerce site and it was fun because we started with an existing B to C
						ecommerce software but normal consumers don’t order $400,000 worth of stuff with 300-line items on it, so
						there’s all kinds of interesting work there. There was a fashion in that stuff as well, so we have to come
						up with new and interesting user interfaces for people to easily order, e.g., size, color and quantity.
						What was interesting is that then solved an immediate problem of allowing franchisees to order complex
						orders easily but then it started providing all kinds of really useful information because it was a lot
						easier mining the data from that and what we started using that for what was called Business Intelligence
						back then and is now all data analytics now, so that we could understand and start to see that patterns and
						trends, so it was a lot more useful for negotiations and election. Then we also started integrating with their
						point of sales system so we could do automatic ordering and various other tools. And the thing about IT is,
						even so in my career, I’ve been in all kinds of different industries and worked in all different kind of
						systems. Themes seem to come back up, like I’ve had a couple of additional logistics-oriented jobs more than a
						couple of retail-oriented jobs, and I also worked in education a few times so even though you’re working in
						different areas in different fields. There’s still core ideas, core principles that you bring to each job and evolve over the years. </p>

	<h1>Project idea traveller booking application</h1>

	<h2> Overview</h2>

	<p>Our group idea would be to create a simple app, one where you could enter your dates of travel, 
	your destination, and the times that suited you. The app would then pull availability from websites, 
	such as <a href ="https://www.webjet.com.au"> Webjet</a> / <a href ="https://www.expedia.com.au"> Expedia</a> / <a href ="https://www.travelocity.com"> Travelocity</a>, <a href ="https://au.hotels.com"> hotel.com</a> / <a href ="https://www.booking.com"> Booking.com</a>
	along with any flights available from respective airline websites. 
	Following that, you would then go on to select your flight, accommodation, and any other services you require, such as a rental car,
	enter your payment information, process the payment to book your spots and then email you your itinerary. 
	We would like the app to be simple to use and all that would be required from the traveller is the dates, times looking to travel,
	number of people traveling and the destination, this will be deliberate so that the app is easily accessible by those who may not be as technologically sound as others. </p>
	<br>
	<div class = line_breaker></div><br>

	
	<h2> Motivation</h2>

	<p> The main reason for the creation of this idea, 
		is because the group thought that people who travel the world for business and leisure are left with little time trying to organise services such as flights, 
		accommodation, and rental cars, etc. While many might consider it an exciting prospect,
		 we believe that it is always quite a chore to scroll through many websites and individually review the choices with respect to flights, accommodation, 
		 and rental cars. We believe that when arranging travel, unless you are a travel agent, there are too many choices for flights, accommodation, and rental cars. 
		 We believe there needs to be simpler way that everyone can access, as the world evolves travellers are now more than ever arranging their own travel and as stated in the
		 <a href ="https://www.travelperk.com/blog/"> Travelperk Blog</a>,
		 <br><br>
		</p>
		
		
		 <button class="accordion2" style = border:solid 1px;>More Information </button>
			<div class="panel">
				<br>
		<p>
			<br>
			“business travellers are tech savvy and less likely to stick, outdated travel policies and methods”, this would include using services such as a travel agent. 
			<br><br>
			also stated in the Travelperk blog, business travellers:  
			<br><br>
			
			“simply prefer self-booking over the agency route. Self-booking lets them collect loyalty points,
			 fly with their favourite airlines, even have the eco-friendly option to choose trains over planes.”
			 <br><br>
			
			 The aim of our project idea is to create a simple mobile application, which aims to be available on both Android and iOS, 
			that streamlines the booking process for individuals and business travellers. It will be a simple format that will allow the user to enter the basic requirements of the trip,
			 such as the date, destination, standard of hotel (1 to 5 stars), 
			 preferred location of hotel and flight times which will also provide options for other flights around the same time as what has been requested. </p> <br>
		 
	
	</div>
	<br>
	<div class = line_breaker></div>
	<br>
						
	<h2> Description</h2>

	<p> This mobile application will allow the customer to create an account and a profile,
		which users will have the option to link any existing frequent flyer memberships or provide links to sign-up for new memberships.
		It will also include hotel and rental car loyalty program details as well as the option to set your preferences for hotels,
		seating position requests on flights and preferences for rental vehicles.
		The customer preferences can be stored and utilized each time the member checks in to the mobile application and performs a search for their next trip,
		rather than having to reset every time you go to book. It could also possibly store a “family” feature, 
		in which you could declare family members and have their details saved to a single profile, 
		which again would eliminate the need for the constant entering of details every time flights and accommodation are booked.  </p>

		  <button class="accordion2" style = border:solid 1px;>More Information </button>
		  <div class="panel">
			  <br>
	<p> This idea would definitely, be useful for the business travellers, however we understand there could be several issues which may make it difficult to bring it to fruition.
		 It would be simple enough in design, using a number of mobile application tools available in the market,
		  however the challenge we believe would be the connectivity to the multitude of hotel, airline and rental car booking sites worldwide. 
		  It would be more viable to connect with the broader booking engines, like <a href ="https://www.webjet.com.au"> Webjet</a>, 
		  <a href ="https://www.booking.com"> Bookings.com</a> and <a href ="https://au.hotels.com"> hotel.com</a>.
		  Another thing to take into consideration is the current worldwide situation with the COVID-19 pandemic, 
		  it would potentially be able to serve better as a product just for the Australian market at the moment, 
		  as opposed to including the international market, that is of course until international travel is resumed.   

		<br><br>
		The application will search for availability from the respective search engines and based on the customer requirements aim to deliver to a single platform 
		on the app and will provide the customer with a selection of options that will suit the travellers’ requirements. 
		Once the selection has been made from the list of flights, accommodation and rental cars, the details are confirmed,
		respective payment methods processed and once the details are confirmed, payment can be made via credit card and other payment methods
		such as PayPal and once payment completed an itinerary can be emailed to the traveller. 
		<br><br>
		With respect to booking hotels & airlines, we believe there are specific booking/cancellation policies that need to be clear and concise, 
		to reduce the number of customer service issues that may arise, as these are often areas of conflict in the hotel business. 
		It is also important for the app to provide a live chat with a support team and the ability for the consumer to communicate directly in case they encounter any issues, 
		with the online booking process. The application will allow changes and an itinerary email to the customer once the entire booking has been completed. 
		The design of the mobile application has to be simple and easy to navigate and not involve to much in the way of the graphics, 
		this is due to our aim of making it easily accessible and operable by people of all technological adeptness. 
		It needs to be quick and effective and provide itineraries that highlight costings that can be used for expense reimbursement purposes for the business traveller. 
		<br><br>
		As for the monetary side of things, this will be a free to use app, upon its release it will incur no charge when attempting to download the app from either the 
		App Store on iOS or the Google Play Store on Android. We would like to have it advertised in a similar fashion to aforementioned websites like Webjet and Bookings.com. 
		Doing this will hopefully allow the app to reach a similar level of exposure among competition and hopefully provide a better alternative for customers to side with. 
		</p>

	<br>


	<h2> Tools + Tech</h2>

	<p> The first plan of action would be to identify an open-source software specifically designed for Flight/ Rental Cars & Hotels reservations. 
		The software should be able to provide live availability of information, have the ability to integrate with other platforms and allow multiple people to book
		using the mobile application, at the one time without stressing the server because as we have seen very recently with the 2Victorian Government travel vouchers,
		travel services tend to overload. It should provide the ability to update the any calendar feature that your device may have, as well as feature secure payment methods.
		As a group, we have decided on using a software called Essential Studio, which after deliberate research and comparing with competitors on 3Capterra, 
		we found to be the best option in regard to providing something easy to use while also remaining in depth enough for us to create the app we want to share, 
		while critically being able to develop apps for both Android and iOS devices. This coupled with the fact this is a free to use software, 
		with no effect on our budget makes it a sound choice. Our own personal computers with full peripherals will be used to collaborate towards the completion of our product.
		 </p>
	<br>
	<div class = line_breaker></div>
	<br>

	<h2> Skills required</h2>

	<p> The skills required to build an app, require knowledge of a programming language, such as Java along with Swift,
		as this is language Apple requires its apps to be created in. Strong knowledge of HTML and CSS is also necessary for creating an attractive application. 
		As it will be a live and constantly updating service, a sound knowledge of Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services would be required,
		as the application we create will live on the cloud. A database would need to be creating for customers, 
		which will mean that a skilled database expert will need to be identified, which will be important to make the application run at a rapid speed
		and with very limited or no issues. That being said, the number one priority is security, given that it is the most important issue, whenever money is involved, 
		as this needs to be addressed, a person with sound knowledge of network security systems, 
		involving the protection of customer information and payment methods will be required.
		We would also aim to have the app updated regularly,
		though we anticipate that these updates will be more focused on fine-tuning and securing the app rather than any extra content releases, 
		as we aim to include the full app from day one. </p>
	<br>
	<div class = line_breaker></div>
	<br>

	<h2> Outcome</h2>

	<p> The outcome would be a product that will make business & individual travel simpler for the customer. 
		It will cut down the amount of time required to make a booking for flights/rental cars & hotels, 
		in real time and that will them to make changes and cancel reservations in a few simple steps. When you consider business travel especially, 
		how much time is spent going between, business travellers, managerial assistants, and travel agents, sometimes it is just simply not viable due to time constraints,
		this app aims to make the process quicker and negate the need for a travel agent altogether, 
		to reduce costs and allow the customers to identify special deals and rates that will in turn save the company money. </p>

			</ul>

			<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>Mark Parisotto was born in Sydney and comes from an Italian background, as such he is capable of speaking some Italian.
			Mark lived in Sydney for his early life until after he had completed his first 5 years of schooling,
			before he moved to the Griffith region of NSW where he remained for the duration of his schooling experience.
			Mark has worked at a number of petrol stations as a customer attendant and is currently employed as a health information officer at a private hospital in Melbourne.
			He has thoroughly enjoyed his career so far however,
			he believes his true passion lies within the realm of Information technology which is why he has decided to pursue his studies here at RMIT.
		<br><br>His hobbies include gaming, ball sports (particularly Rugby and Soccer), Music (Rock and Metal) and fixing cars.</a>.</p>

			<h2>Intrest in IT</h2>
		<p>Mark has always had a strong interest in IT, starting at a young age when he used to play flash games on his parents computer.
		 Over the years his fascination grew leading him to take IT electives whilst in highschool which led him to study a diploma of IT once he graduated.
		 Marks Interest in IT is centered heavily around Information security and programming with an expressed interest in programming of intelligent systems. </p>

		  <h2>Personality Type</h2>


		  <div class = "teamImg2">
	<img src="images/Mark-Test.png" alt="" />

		</div>
	<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
		<p> Mark is a Mediator and a tactile learner, the mediator personality is indicative of people who may seem quiet or unassuming at first although they often have vibrant private and social lives. 
			Idealistic and their natural care for others leads them to pursue deep meaningful relationships and they are always happy to help others in need. 
			Mediators can often feel as if their lives are lacking in direction and purpose, for many this purpose lies within the realm of assisting others while they are aware that the world will never be perfect,
			however they still care in assisting to make it a little better.</p>
			<br>
			
			<p>As a tactile learner Mark learns in a “hands on” way, preferring to touch, build, draw or otherwise act out what the skills are he is attempting to learn.
				 It is recommended that he is active and take frequent breaks, tactile learners are more likely to use their hands and make gestures when speaking and can have
				  difficulty in remaining seated for extended periods of time, hence why it is recommended for them to take regular breaks. </p>
<br>
<h2>Reflection</h2>
<br>
<p>The results of the tests mean a fair bit to mark, he states that they are always a good indicator of what your true personality is.
	In particular the Myers-Briggs test really goes into detail about how your personality affects your day to day life and gives a good insight into personality traits which he did not know he had.
	Because of this reason, mark believes that everyone  can benefit by taking one or more of these tests in order to potentially learn something new about themselves as long as they are honest about their answers
	to the questions on the test. Mark believes that the personality traits he posses and the traits that have been reflected in his test results allow him to work well within a team, the personality type:
	Mediator, is an integral part of any team as they are able to assist in peacefully and fairly resolving conflicts when they arise.
	As a Mediator mark believes that he is capable of forming and taking opinions from both sides and will be able to effectively keep everybody on track with their tasks.</p>

	<p>Max, who lives in Cairns North Queensland, is a 25 year old student of RMIT. He has previously studied a diploma at CQU and worked in the ADF. 
		His interest in IT started because of his father, who was an IT consultant working from home. Hence Max was always surrounded by computers and servers.
		Knowledge and interest in IT was accelerated during work in the ADF.
		<br><br>His hobbies include: working out, gaming and programming.</p>
		<br>

		<h2>Intrest in IT </h2>
		<p>Max has had an Interest in IT since he was quite young, his dad worked as an It consultant so he grew up in an environment where he was exposed to a number of different systems from an early age. 
			His curiosity grew until he joined the army in 2012 where he was exposed to the full scope of what encompasses the umbrella term of “IT” having to learn and become proficient in utilising new radios
			, gps and other military technologies his interest peaked and he decided to leave the ADF and pursue a career in Information Technology </p>

		  <h2>Personality Type</h2>
		
		<p>Max is a Logician and a visual learner. Logicians are people who love patterns and technology. Often they have abstract ideas, 
			which can seem counter-intuitive at first glance however generally these ideas prove to be remarkable innovations, 
			Logicians can often become so caught up in their own train of thought that they can forget to consider the emotional side of things, 
			this is often perceived as a lack of sympathy and is often attributed to them being considered inconsiderate by their peers. 
			Max agrees that often he can become caught up in his own thoughts so much that he over analyses the problem and can miss the point entirely.</p>
			<br>
			<div class = "teamImg2">
				<img src="images/Max-Test.png" alt="" />
			</div>
			<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
		

		<p>As a visual learner Max is more prone to learning quicker if the information or tasks required are presented in a written or picture form, instead of verbal, or hands on. 
			Visual learners learn quicker when they create their own diagrams and pictures to explain or represent the information. 
			They should try to study or learn in an environment that is free from visual distractions and should use different fonts, 
			styles and colors for different meanings when studying and taking notes.</p>
<br>
<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>Max agrees with the results of his tests for the most part, however he has stated that he is unaware of any other personality types. 
	After reviewing his results from the tests max believes that his traits are not Ideal for working in a team his introverted personality and constant overthinking are likely to hinder 
	his performance and make him unlikely to present his ideas to the group. Max states he has difficulty explaining and articulating his ideas and opinions and can become easily frustrated when
	 others do not understand his ideas. Max disagreed with some of the personality traits he was given with his results, in his opinion he is not necessarily very creative, and says he has difficulty 
	 in coming up with ideas for stories and has terrible graphical skills (such as drawing). Max also considers himself more of a practical learner instead of a visual, believing he will only ever truly
	  learn how to do something once he has gone through the motions many times.</p>

		</ul>

		<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>Lewis was born in England and immigrated to Australia when he was 11, he was particularly gifted in mathematics during his schooling and represented his schools in soccer and chess. 
		Lewis studied accounting at night and became a member of the Institute of public Accountants in 1979, the following year he started his undergraduate degree in mathematics at Flinders University.
		 Whilst working as an accountant Lewis was exposed to Programming which he thoroughly enjoyed and evolved into a hobby during his free time.
		  This hobby is what led Lewis to study a bachelors of IT through RMIT. 
		Lewis enjoys programming, and supporting his towns football team, (Swindon) nicknamed “The Robins”.
		 </p>

		<h2>Intrest in IT</h2>
		<p> Lewis gained an interest in IT when he started working as an accountant in the finance department of ZZZ. 
			He was the first person at his workplace to learn the macro programming ability of 123 and Excel (VBA).
			 His workplace skills quickly became a beloved hobby and he started to teach himself how to write other programs and use breadboards such as the Adruino and the Raspberry Pi, 
			 eventually Lewis decided to pursue a bachelor’s degree which led him to RMIT.</p>

		  <h2>Personality Type</h2>
		  <p>Lewis is an Adventurer and a Tactile learner. The explorer personality trait is indicative of those who are Observant,
			   feeling and Prospective in nature, they are true artists at their core but generally in an unconventional way they gain pleasure in pushing the limits of social norms and conventions.
			    Adventurers live in a world inspired by connections with people and take joy in reinterpreting these connections by experimenting with them and considering new perspective,
				 this combines with their natural spontaneity, often makes them seem unpredictable even to those who have close personal relationships with them.
<br><br>
<br>
		<div class = "teamImg2">
			<img src="images/Lewis-test.svg" alt="" /></div>
			<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
			As another tactile learner of the group Lewis learns best by taking a practical and methodological approach to learning,
			 the need to go through the motions, make errors and then learn from them is an integral part of learning for the tactile learner. 
			 Lewis finds that in long lectures and reading material he can “switch” off and is more of less watching rather than doing anything stating he “learns best by doing”.
			</p>

<br>
<h2>Reflection</h2>
<br>
<p>Lewis believes that the results of his tests are somewhat accurate, he agrees he has an adventurous nature and is observant and prospective,
	and In his younger years he was quite outgoing, contradicting one of the perceptions from the Briggs-Myers test stating that adventures are Introverted people.
	However this appears to be the only discrepancy with the tests Lewis took, he also completed an IQ test and received a score of 105-120 putting him above the national 
	average of 99.2. Lewis states that his test results state or indicate that he should not be a leader however he states that his most enjoyable and productive time at ZZZ
	was when he was managing the finance IT team, sometimes the test results miss certain things and others a person who undertakes the test may have results that are very 
	close to putting them within a different classification and this may be the case for lewis.</p>
